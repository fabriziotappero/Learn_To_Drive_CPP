# What is this? 
A C++ implementation of an **artificial intelligence** that can drive.

# How to compile
Install g++ (in Windows you can use MSYS2) and run:

    g++ -o main.exe main.cpp -O2 -s -DNDEBUG -luser32 -lgdi32 -lopengl32 -lgdiplus -lShlwapi -ldwmapi -lstdc++fs -static -std=c++17

 # What it does
 this is the main and on GUI. 
 
 As you might have noticed from the code, it uses the great open-source **Pixel Game Engine** by olc. Have a look here for into and documentation:

 # Why I made this
 Essentially I wanted to improve my C++ skills by implementing an *articial intelligence* that can process images in real time using a *graphic game engine*. 
 If you actually want to implement stuff it is a good idea to find data to process, a game engine has indeed a ton of video data!
 
 Regarding AI, on the web you can find a lot of implementations made in Python but not so many made in C++.
